The provided boilerplate code is a solid starting point for developing your CRDT-based application for merging Excel formulas. Here’s an assessment of how well it aligns with your tasks:

### Create 10 - 20 Merging Examples of Simple Excel Formulas

- The `FormulaParserWrapper` class, along with the underlying parser implementation, is set up to parse Excel formulas into ASTs. 
- For creating merging examples, you'll manually need to define these formulas and their expected merged outcomes. This part is more about designing test cases rather than coding.

### Create Code for Merging these 10 - 20 Examples of Simple Formulas

- The `CRDTCore` class is where you’ll implement the merging logic. Currently, it's set up to parse two formulas into ASTs, but the actual merging logic (`# CRDT merging logic goes here`) is yet to be implemented.
- You will need to flesh out the `merge_asts` method to handle the merging based on CRDT principles.

### Create a Comprehensive List of Merging Rules

- This task is more theoretical and documentation-oriented. You'll need to define these rules based on how you want your CRDT to handle conflicts and merges. 
- These rules should eventually be translated into code within the `ConflictResolver` class and possibly within the `CRDTCore`'s merging logic.

### Develop a Function to Add Metadata to the Formula Nodes

- The `MetadataManager` class is intended for this purpose. You'll need to implement the `add_metadata` method to attach necessary metadata (like timestamps, user IDs, etc.) to the AST nodes.
- This metadata will be crucial for the conflict resolution process.

### Additional Observations

- The provided parser and its integration seem well-aligned with the project's needs. It can parse formulas into ASTs, which is the first step in your CRDT process.
- The `ASTModificationTracker` class is where you’ll track changes to ASTs. The implementation of this tracking logic is crucial for understanding how ASTs evolve over time, which is important for CRDT operations.
- Testing: The `test_parser.py` and `test_crdt_core.py` files indicate a good start towards a TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach. You will need to expand these tests to cover a wide range of scenarios, including different types of merges and conflict resolutions.

### Conclusion

Your boilerplate code sets a clear structure and outlines the key components needed for your project. The next steps involve implementing the logic in each of these components and expanding your test cases to ensure the system works as expected. Remember, developing CRDTs can be complex, so iterative development and thorough testing will be crucial to your success.
