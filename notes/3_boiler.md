Sure, let's create a boilerplate for your CRDT project. This code will be structured to match the components we've outlined in the software architecture and will include placeholders for the key functionalities.

### Boilerplate Structure

1. **Parser**: To parse Excel formulas into ASTs.
2. **AST Modification and Tracking**: To track changes in ASTs.
3. **CRDT Core**: The core logic for CRDT merging.
4. **Metadata Management**: For handling metadata on AST nodes.
5. **Conflict Resolution Engine**: To resolve conflicts during merging.
6. **Test Harness**: A simple testing setup to validate the CRDT logic.

### Boilerplate Code

#### Parser (parser.py)

```python

# parser.py
class ExcelFormulaParser:
    def parse(self, formula):
        # TODO: Implement formula parsing logic
        # Return AST
        pass
```

#### AST Modification and Tracking (ast_modification.py)

```python
# ast_modification.py
class ASTModificationTracker:
    def track_changes(self, ast):
        # TODO: Implement logic to track changes in AST
        pass
```

#### CRDT Core (crdt_core.py)

```python
# crdt_core.py
class CRDTCore:
    def merge_asts(self, ast1, ast2):
        # TODO: Implement CRDT logic for merging ASTs
        pass
```

#### Metadata Management (metadata_management.py)

```python
# metadata_management.py
class MetadataManager:
    def add_metadata(self, ast):
        # TODO: Implement logic to add metadata to AST nodes
        pass
```

#### Conflict Resolution Engine (conflict_resolution.py)

```python
# conflict_resolution.py
class ConflictResolver:
    def resolve_conflicts(self, merged_ast):
        # TODO: Implement logic to resolve conflicts in merged AST
        pass
```

#### Test Harness (test_harness.py)

```python
# test_harness.py
from parser import ExcelFormulaParser
from ast_modification import ASTModificationTracker
from crdt_core import CRDTCore
from metadata_management import MetadataManager
from conflict_resolution import ConflictResolver

def run_tests():
    # Setup test environment
    parser = ExcelFormulaParser()
    tracker = ASTModificationTracker()
    crdt_core = CRDTCore()
    metadata_manager = MetadataManager()
    resolver = ConflictResolver()

    # TODO: Add test cases to evaluate the CRDT functionality

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_tests()
```

### Next Steps

1. **Implement the Logic**: Each `TODO` comment in the code is a placeholder for the actual implementation of that component's logic.
2. **Testing and Iteration**: After implementing each component, use the test harness to run scenarios that test the CRDT logic.

### Conclusion

This boilerplate code provides a structured starting point for your CRDT project. Each component is represented by a Python class, with methods outlined for the required functionalities. The test harness at the end ties everything together, providing a framework for testing the integrated functionality of the system. As you develop the project, you'll fill in the logic for each component and expand the test cases to ensure everything works as expected.
